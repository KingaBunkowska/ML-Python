### Overview

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects that I have worked on. These projects are very simple, focused on learning new things. Feel free to provide feedback or share ideas for improvement.

### Projects

- **Crab Age Prediction**: Predicting the age of crabs using linear regression.
- **Digits Classification**: A simple digit classification project; I experimented with creating my own dataset.
- **Iris Linear Regression**: Predicting a numerical value of sepal lenght. Pandas was used to simplify data processing.
